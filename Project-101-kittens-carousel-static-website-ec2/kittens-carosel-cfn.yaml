Description: |
  This CloudFormation Template was written for
  running Kittens Carousel Static Website on EC2.
  Kittens Carousel Static Website will be
  deployed on Amazon Linux 2
  (ami-05fa00d4c63e32376) EC2 Instance with
  custom security group which allows http
  connections on port 80 and ssh port 22 from
  anywhere. Kittens Carousel Static Website
  is downloaded from my Public Github repository,
  then deployed on Apache Web Server.
